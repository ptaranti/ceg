\title{Chain Event Graph (ceg)}
\description{
This package has functionalities that allow us to create and learn
Chain Event Graph (CEG) models using a Bayesian framework. It provides us
with a Hierarchical Agglomerative algorithm to search the CEG model space.
}
\details{
The package also includes several facilities for visualisations of the
objects associated with a CEG. The CEG class can represent a range of
relational data types, and supports arbitrary vertex, edge and graph
attributes. A Chain Event Graph is a tree-based graphical model that
provides a powerful graphical interface through which domain experts can
easily translate a process into sequences of observed events using plain
language. CEGs have been a useful class of graphical model especially to
capture context-specific conditional independences.

Currently, ceg provides implementation to support the stratified family,
the user will use the following classes:

\itemize{
\item Stratified.ceg.model
\item Stratified.staged.tree
\item Stratified.event.tree
}

These classes are implemented as S4 classes and have constructor methods with
the same name as the class. A \code{plot} method is also provided.
