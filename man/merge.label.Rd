\title{Merge labels of multiple edges.}
\usage{
\method{merge}{label}(edge.list, edge, level)
}
\arguments{
\item{edge.list}{vector    list of positions that a children of a specific
position v1.}

\item{edge}{numeric    a particular children "edge" of a specific position v1}

\item{level}{vector    labels of classes corrresponding to the variable
associated with a position.}
}
\value{
string	 merged labels associated with a specific position v1.
}
\description{
Merge labels of multiple edges in order to plot them all.
}
\details{
This function mitigates a limitation from Rgraphviz, since it is not
possible to plot multiple edges between two nodes presenting the correct
edge label for each one. The authors did not find a graphical package
providing this capability. Contributions are wellcomed.

This is a inner function, not intended to be exported to users.
