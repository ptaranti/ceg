Description: This package has functionalities that allow us to create and learn
    Chain Event Graph (CEG) models using a Bayesian framework. It provides us with a
    Hierarchical Agglomerative algorithm to search the CEG model space. The package
    also includes several facilities for visualisations of the objects associated
    with a CEG. The CEG class can represent a range of relational data types, and
    supports arbitrary vertex, edge and graph attributes. A Chain Event Graph is a
    tree-based graphical model that provides a powerful graphical interface through
    which domain experts can easily translate a process into sequences of observed
    events using plain language. CEGs have been a useful class of graphical model
    especially to capture context-specific conditional independences.
