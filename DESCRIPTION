Description: Create and learn Chain Event Graph (CEG) models using a Bayesian 
    framework. It provides us with a Hierarchical Agglomerative algorithm to 
    search the CEG model space.
    The package also includes several facilities for visualisations of the
    objects associated with a CEG. The CEG class can represent a range of
    relational data types, and supports arbitrary vertex, edge and graph
    attributes. A Chain Event Graph is a tree-based graphical model that
    provides a powerful graphical interface through which domain experts can
    easily translate a process into sequences of observed events using plain
    language. CEGs have been a useful class of graphical model especially to
    capture context-specific conditional independences. References: Collazo R,
